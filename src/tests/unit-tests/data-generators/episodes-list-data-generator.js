        "Rick Rubin’s music education and evolution, from 1. Falling in love with the Beatles’ Rock and Roll Music at three or four years old and chasing that feeling of transcendence the rest of his life → 2. Growing up in “uncool” Long Island and liking all genres without caring what anyone thought → 3. Rick’s taste evolving and recording with his high school noisy punk rock band, Hose → 4. Intro to hip hop at NYU, buying records and going to Negril → 5. Evolving into a producer who approaches music as a fan, not a musician → 6. Rick’s advice to aspiring musicians\n \nRick Rubin is a nine-time GRAMMY Award-winning producer, named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by TIME and the most successful producer in any genre by Rolling Stone. The author of the book The Creative Act: A Way of Being, he has collaborated with artists from Tom Petty to Adele, Johnny Cash to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys to Slayer, Kanye West to the Strokes, and System of a Down to Jay-Z.\n\nFollow Silverlake Conservatory of Music at @silverlake_conservatory \nFor more information on Parallel, visit parallel.la\nFollow Cadence13 at @cadence13\nFollow Rick Rubin at @rickrubin \nFollow Flea at @flea333\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
